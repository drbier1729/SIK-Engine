Welcome to your repository!

Everyone: Clone this repository to your developer machine, then create a local branch for your work.  

Typically local branches are going to be a combination of your name/id and a suffix (the suffix allows you to have multiple branches going on at once)

For instance, I typically start a task with
```
   # switch to the main branch (which you'll keep clean of any local changes) 
   git checkout main

   # sync code by pulling from GitHub
   git pull origin main

   # make a feature branch and checkout (using your name or id as the prefix)
   git checkout -b fleegal-main

   # do some work, commit to the local branch
   # then, when ready for code review (called PR in GitHub)
   git push origin fleegal-main
   # this creates a new github branch called "fleegal-main` and you then go to the GitHub website to commence the code-review (PR)
```

Tech Director:  You should create the initial directiories for your project.  Plan this out with your team on a whiteboard, make the changes in a local branch, push and get someone on your team to approve the changes
